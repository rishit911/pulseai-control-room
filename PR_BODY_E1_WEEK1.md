## ðŸš€ PR: Engineerâ€‘1 Weekâ€‘1 â€” Ingestion & Validation Pipeline (ZenML + MLflow)

### ðŸ”‘ What's included

- **ZenML pipeline** (`ingestion_validation_pipeline`) with steps:
  - `ingest_data`: reads small CSV (with safe fallback)
  - `validate_data`: schema & null checks against `configs/schema.yaml`
- **Artifacts**:
  - `MLOps_Engineer1/artifacts/validation/validation_results.json`
  - `MLOps_Engineer1/artifacts/validation/validation_report.html`
- **MLflow logging**:
  - Metric: `validation_ok`
  - Validation JSON & HTML logged as artifacts
- **UI integration** (safe adapter):
  - `MLOps_Engineer4/app/integrations/engineer1_pipelines.py` delegates to E1 bridge
  - Optional repoâ€‘root import fix at top of `app/main.py` (idempotent)
- **CI**:
  - `.github/workflows/validate_e1.yml` runs pipeline on PRs
- **Dev convenience**:
  - `scripts/run_all.bat` / `scripts/run_all.sh` oneâ€‘click setup & run
  - `MLOps_Engineer1/smoke_test.py` endâ€‘toâ€‘end check

### âœ… How to test locally

```bash
# Windows
scripts\run_all.bat

# macOS/Linux
bash scripts/run_all.sh
```

Then open Streamlit (http://localhost:8501) â†’ Data Health shows validation status.

**MLflow UI** (optional):
```bash
mlflow ui â†’ http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

- **Zero intrusive UI edits**: only the E1 adapter and optional sys.path prepend.
- **No other files** under `MLOps_Engineer4/**` were changed.
- **Lays the foundation** for Weekâ€‘2 (baseline model training + versioning).
